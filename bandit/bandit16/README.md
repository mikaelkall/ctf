# Bandit Level 16 → Level 17

## Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

## Summary

```
Welcome to my 1st hackit.
This hackit is for people who want to test their knowledge in PHP / SQL security.
It has some similarities to h0yt3r's and shadowleet's sql-injection hackits but it will also test you in some logical ways of thinking.
All levels are based on real vulnerabilitys I found in the wild.
Be honest. Dont bruteforce the passwords and dont make any solutions public!!!
Well I am not a friend of long speeches so just start now.
